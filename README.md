# Notes App (Python)
A simple command‑line notes application built using Python.
This project was created to help me practice structuring programs with functions, working with files, and building a clean menu‑driven CLI app.

 ## Features
- 	Add notes with timestamps
- 	View all saved notes
- 	Search notes by keyword
- 	Delete notes by selecting their number
-   Clear all notes
-   Improved formatting when viewing notes
- 	Automatic file creation if notes.txt doesn’t exist

## How to Run

Tested with: **Python 3.12**

> **Windows note: when downloading '.py' files from the internet, Windows may show a security warning.
> This is a standard mesage for all Python scripts and not specific to this project.

1. 	Clone the repository
2. 	No external dependencies required
3. 	Run the app: python notes.py

## Tech Used

- 	Python 3
- 	VS Code
- 	Standard library modules:
-  datetime for timestamps
- 	File I/O (open, read, write)

 ## Future Improvements

- 	Save notes in JSON instead of plain text
-   Load notes from JSON
- 	GUI version (Tkinter or PyQt)
- 	More advanced formatting options
