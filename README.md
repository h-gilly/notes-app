# Notes App (Python)
A simple command‑line notes application built using Python.
This project was created to help me practice structuring programs with functions, working with files, and building a clean menu‑driven CLI app.

 ## Features
- 	Add notes with timestamps
- 	View all saved notes
- 	Search notes by keyword
- 	Delete notes by selecting their number
- 	Automatic file creation if notes.txt doesn’t exist


## How to Run

Windows note:
When downloading .py files from the internet, Windows may show a security warning.
This is a standard message for all Python scripts and not specific to this project.

1. 	Clone the repository
2. 	No external dependencies required
3. 	Run the app: python notes.py

**Tested with:** Python 3.12+

## Tech Used
- 	Python 3
- 	VS Code
- 	Standard library modules:
    -  datetime for timestamps
    - 	File I/O (open, read/write`)


 ## Future Improvements
- 	Clear all notes option
- 	Better formatting when viewing notes
- 	Save notes in JSON instead of plain text
- 	GUI version (Tkinter or PyQt)
